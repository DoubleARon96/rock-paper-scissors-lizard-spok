2. rules at the bottom to understand why you won or lost the round
3. a rest button so you can try beat your score

The goals set for this project are:

1. To have a fully working mini game
2. rules that the code understands and goes through to give results
3. button interaction so the customer can interact with the game

## UX

While planning and taking in the principles of UX, planning how it will bring in the audience and future customers.

Website Target audience:

* ages between 18 to 40.
* big bang theory fans.
* people that have to wait for a little bit of time.
* also for groups of friends.
  
What the clients will be looking for:

* Easy way to pass time.
* Clear and high-quality Pictures.
* the correct results.
  
the plan is to hit all of these targets and keep improving and adapting.

the website is responsive to cover all bases because the age range we are aiming for the site covers both mobile to full-screen computers.

### Structure

the website is a basic rock paper scissors lizard spock with two images that change to the image you have chosen. under that you have the player choices these are buttons that go red after selecting your choice,
after that there is player wins, losses and moves left, the numbers will increase for the for the player wins and losses but the moves left will decrees instead.

the reset button will reset everything on the screen so the images will go to the default and all the wins losses and moves left will go back to their default number.

the last element is the rules are responsive and fit with the page they have what wins and says why to, it changes from inline-flex to inline-table. an addition i am planning on making the rule that the game out come will change colour so its easier than.

the background has different background colours dependent on the screen size for a extra change 

### Scope

To help achieve our company goals the full deployment will have:

* simply design so anyone can use it.
* images clear and high quality.
* 
* sign up page to get in contact with the clients
* downloadable catalog
* links to social media forms
* Newsletter sign-up form

### Surface

the colour scheme I choose was to match the Samco company and keep with their colour scheme

I also used Verdana font because it was nice and worked well with the site shape all the other fonts I tried just didn't feel right

### Features

The web page is fully responsive and designed for mobile phones and then moved up through the screen sizes. the page is set out into sections to make it easier to read with a header nav bar, then main information, and then a footer.

### needs title

![](docs/Images/navbar-picture.png)

the nav bar i have made it so it shrinks and grows with the screen size. it also has only three sections at the moment.

### needs title

![](docs/Images/about-page-infomation.png)

the main information moves with the screen size the bigger screens it moves to the middle to get rid of a big white space.
on small screens, it makes the image float to the right and keeps in line with it.

### needs title

![](docs/Images/gallery.png)

the gallery also adjusts the screen size and adds columns depending on the screen size and keeps all the pictures from blurring or pixelating.

### needs title

![](docs/Images/form.png)

the signup page is there for customers to sign up for news, it also sends info about vehicles, Cars bikes, and others so it can filter what they have I have also made it so they are not required to click any so they just get all information instead of specific information.

### Submit Page

[](docs/Images/submit-page.png)

the submit page has a little thank you message and a home button but it also has the nav bar so it's down to the user what they press, in the future, I would like to add more content to this page.

  * Coding institute love running Project helped me do the four I liked the way it looked simple but smooth
* [Google Developer Tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
  * Google Developer tool I used this to help fix issues without having to mess around with the main code.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * Used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
* [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
  * Used as the development environment.
  * [Favicon. io](https://favicon.io/)

### Testing

These are the tests I have done

1. The first thing I did was test if the deployed link works
2. I waited for the screen to load all good next I went through all the nave bars to see if they all worked and went through each one trying different paths for example on the gallery page you have the link to the homer and sign up so I tried both of them too.
3. after checking the links I went back to the home page to check the footer links and I did the same with each page.
4. when that was all good I checked that all pictures were loading and the CSS was working.
5. now it was the signup form that made sure all the main stuff like first name, last name, and email are all required and the email one looks for @ symbol.
6. next was the submit page I checked everything loaded and the home link worked
7. the final step was checking all the links on that page worked.

##### Code Valadation

   with this I used W3 mark-up checker by copying each page and the CSS in and if there were any problems I fixed them and and ran it again.

##### Grammarly

   I thought that the best thing to check was my spelling and Grammarly helped load all I did was copy, paste, and check it breaks down all the errors and lets you fix them all.

##### Lighthouse check

   ![](docs/Images/light-house-check.png)
   this was the easiest one just open the Google Development tool and then click on more tools then lighthouse and the final part press the check button

### Deployment

1. Log in to GitHub
2. In your Repository section, select the project repository that you want to deploy
3. In the menu located at the top of this section, click 'Settings'
4. Select 'Pages' on the left-hand menu - this is around halfway down
5. In the source section, select branch 'main' and save
6. The page is then given a site URL which you will see above the source section, it will look like the following:

![](docs/github-deployment.png)

Please note it can take a while for this link to become fully active.

*Forking the GitHub Repository*

If you want to make changes to your repository without affecting it, you can make a copy of it by 'Forking' it. This ensures your original repository remains unchanged.

1. Find the correct GitHub repository
2. In the top right corner of the page, click the Fork button
3. Your repository has now been 'Forked' and you have a copy to do what you want to.

*Cloning the GitHub Repository*

Cloning your repository will allow you to download a local version of the repository to be worked on. Cloning is a good way to back up your work and have a spare copy

1. Find the relevant GitHub repository
2. Press the arrow on the Code button
3. Copy the link that is shown in the drop-down
4. Now open Gitpod & and select the directory location where you would like the clone created
5. In the terminal type 'git clone' & and then paste the link you copied into GitHub
6. Press enter and your local clone will be created.

### Bugs

I tried multiple times to make a checkbox drop-down but just couldn't get it to work so I made the three tabs look good in all screen sizes and make sure they fit all. in the future, i would research more on the dropdown and build a few to help in future projects
